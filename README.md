# Ping-Pong
Hello, to all players and coders! Ping Pong is a little bit like arkanoid or let us say 'air hockey'. This 2-player game tests your gaming skills and is extremly amusing. All you do is twiddle with a few buttons and the ball goes swinging to the other oppent. Currently, the ball does not go off the spacious screen and is very accurate in its speed.
